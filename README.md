# notes for explaining

In Azure Cosmos DB, data is stored in containers, which are logical units of storage that correspond to a table-like structure. You can create multiple containers within a Cosmos DB database to store different types of data or to partition your data for scalability. a

Containers in Cosmos DB are schema-agnostic, which means that they don't enforce a fixed schema on the data stored within them. You can store documents with different structures within the same container, and you can change the schema of a container at any time.

However, it's important to note that containers are not equivalent to traditional SQL tables, as they do not enforce a fixed schema or primary key constraints. Instead, Cosmos DB provides a flexible data model that allows you to store and query data in a variety of ways.

So, to answer your question, you can create multiple containers in a Cosmos DB database to organize your data in different ways, but these containers are not equivalent to traditional SQL tables.
